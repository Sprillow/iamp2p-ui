  s2: `In computing field, a protocol is defined as: a computer language allowing computers that are connected to each other to communicate. 
  So think language, with a set of rules defining how entities communicate. `,

  s3: `My characteristics and affordances are different from other protocols, like the "client-server" model, which is what probably you've mostly used before.`,

  s4: `Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application 
  architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. 
  They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.`,

      You can chat with me, look at some key terms in{' '}

  s9: `The Internet Protocol Suite is a set of communications protocols, and specifies how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. 
  This functionality is organized in 4 layers.`,

  s10: `Think of it like a building that has a foundation, first floor, second floor, etc. stacked on top of each other.`,

  s11: `The top layer is the "application layer". It interacts with software applications (like me!) to implement a communicating component.`,

  s12: `One of the most common application layer protocols you've probably used is HTTP (and HTTPS). That's how you access web browsers, for example Blackwood gallery's website. That's probably how you've found me ;)`,

  s13: `Peer-to-peer protocols are another kind of possible protocols in the application layer. They provide a different kind of networking than the application layer protocols you've seen or used.`,

      Same with GoogleDrive, DropBox, iCloud, and many other things which you
      probably have been using to store your data other than in your hard drive

   A distributed application architecture partitions tasks or workloads between peers.`,

      If I were to draw client-server and peer-to-peer conceptual frameworks
      each, they would be something like this:

  Let's play a little experimental transaction game that's built in to this app to see for yourself how I function on Holochain.`,

      This distinction can have important implications-- including social and
      political. Plus it creates specific applications for each model:

  the power dynamics, between the server and receiver. Think about these implications: `,
